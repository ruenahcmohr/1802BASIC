# 1802BASIC
1802 TinyBasic recovered from hard media

re-digitization of the TINYBASIC found by @MakeAugusta on twitter.
Please note that this does not reflect the suspicious offset of 0x8400 in the address.
(It looks like the first 16kbits of ROM is missing?)

Next step is to decompile it! (please, see if you can beat me to it!)
